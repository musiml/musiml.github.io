  <p>
    We are pleased to announce the <b>3rd Muslims in Machine Learning (MusIML)</b> Workshop, which will take place at <b>NeurIPS 2024</b> on <b>Tuesday, December 10th, 2024</b>, from 1:00 PM - 6:00 PM PST in West Meeting Room 215-216, Vancouver Convention Center, Vancouver, Canada. This workshop aims to amplify the development and use of machine learning (ML) in Muslim communities including Muslim-majority countries and strategies for global societal impact through AI and ML.
  </p>
    
    
  <h2>Workshop Overview</h2>
  <hr>
  The MusIML workshop serves as a platform for researchers and practitioners to explore the intersection of machine learning, AI, and Muslim communities. Our mission is to promote high-quality research that not only fosters growth within Muslim communities but also advances strategies to improve fairness, inclusion, and ethical AI. We encourage contributions that address these challenges and highlight how ML can be a tool for positive change, especially for Muslims in both Muslim-majority countries and global communities.
  
  <h2>Workshop Tracks</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>The workshop will feature two primary research tracks:</p>

  <h3>Track 1: Machine Learning Research by Muslim Authors</h3>
  <p>This track invites submissions from researchers who self-identify as Muslim. We encourage work that explores the frontiers of machine learning and AI, including but not limited to:</p>

  <ul>
      <li><b>LLMs, MLLMs, Generative AI:</b> Research focused on large language models, generative AI systems, cutting-edge vision models, self-supervised learning, and advancements in multilingual capabilities, especially for languages spoken by Muslim communities.</li>
      <li><b>Applications of ML</b> in vision, language, speech, and audio.</li>
      <li><b>Machine learning for society</b> (e.g., education, health, climate, social sciences).</li>
      <li><b>Probabilistic methods</b>, Deep Learning, Reinforcement learning, and Optimization.</li>
      <li><b>Social and economic aspects of machine learning</b> (e.g., fairness, interpretability, human-AI interaction, privacy, safety, strategic behavior).</li>
      <li><b>Federated Learning and AI-driven innovations</b> for Healthcare and smart cities and public services such as governance, energy, and traffic management.</li>
      <li><b>Evaluation Methodologies</b> and Scalable Infrastructures.</li>
      <li><b>Robotics & NeuroAI</b> including research at the intersection of Neuroscience, AI, and Cognitive science.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Track 2: ML Research Addressing Challenges Faced by Muslim Communities</h3>
  <p>This track is open to all researchers, regardless of religious or ethnic background, and encourages submissions that promote the use of ML to support and empower Muslim communities globally, including in Muslim-majority countries. Areas of interest include:</p>

  <ul>
      <li><b>Growth of Muslims in ML:</b> Initiatives that expand educational and professional opportunities for Muslims in ML, promote access, and encourage representation in the field.</li>
      <li><b>ML for social good:</b> Using ML/AI to engage Muslim youth, promote community outreach, enhance societal well-being, and improve governance, healthcare, or education in Muslim communities.</li>
      <li><b>Language and speech technologies:</b> Advancements in tools for languages spoken in Muslim communities, such as Arabic, Urdu, and Persian.</li>
      <li><b>Computational analysis of Islamic scriptures:</b> Digital humanities research, including computational studies of Hadith or Quranic texts.</li>
      <li><b>Data collection and representation:</b> Rich datasets from diverse Muslim communities.</li>
      <li><b>Mitigating algorithmic bias and discrimination:</b> Research exploring strategies that mitigate the algorithmic bias that impacts Muslim individuals and communities.</li>
  </ul>
