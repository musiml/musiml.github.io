      <hr style="height:6px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">

  <p>We invite submissions of extended abstracts for the Muslims in ML Workshop at NeurIPS 2024. We invite submissions both from authors who self-identify as Muslim (Track 1) and by authors researching topics that address challenges faced by the Muslim community (Track 2). Papers are published in a non-archival format and may have been published in other venues before or may be published in other venues in the future.</p>
  
  <p>Authors of accepted abstracts will be invited to a poster session. Selected abstracts will be additionally invited to give a lighting talk. Talks will follow a hybrid format, with authors having the option to present in person or remotely; however, all posters must be presented in person. Additionally, participants will have the exciting opportunity to present at a joint poster session with all affinity groups at NeurIPS (e.g. Women in ML, Black in AI.). We will recognize outstanding posters with a Best Poster Award.</p>

<!--   
  <p>The Muslims in ML workshop focus on both the potential for advancement and harm to Muslims and those in Muslim-majority countries who religiously identify, culturally associate, or are classified by proximity, as “Muslim”. Track 1 is designed to broadly showcase research by Muslim scholars in ML. Track 2 is designed to highlight work addressing challenges faced by the muslim community. Both tracks aim to promote awareness, collaboration, and mitigation strategies to ensure fair and equitable implementation of AI/ML technologies for Muslims worldwide.</p>


  <h3>Track 1</h3>
  <p>Topics related to ML and AI, including but not limited to:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Applications (e.g., vision, language, speech and audio)</li>
    <li>Deep learning (e.g., architectures, generative models, optimization for deep networks)</li>
    <li>Evaluation (e.g., methodology, meta studies, replicability and validity)</li>
    <li>General machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, online, active, etc.)</li>
    <li>Infrastructure (e.g., libraries, improved implementation and scalability, distributed solutions)</li>
    <li>Machine learning for sciences (e.g. climate, health, life sciences, physics, social sciences)</li>
    <li>Neuroscience and cognitive science (e.g., neural coding, brain-computer interfaces)</li>
    <li>Optimization (e.g., convex and non-convex, stochastic, robust)</li>
    <li>Probabilistic methods (e.g., variational inference, causal inference, Gaussian processes)</li>
    <li>Reinforcement learning (e.g., decision and control, planning, hierarchical RL, robotics)</li>
    <li>Social and economic aspects of machine learning (e.g., fairness, interpretability, human-AI interaction, privacy, safety, strategic behavior)</li>
    <li>Theory (e.g., control theory, learning theory, algorithmic game theory)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Track 2</h3>
  <p>Topics related to challenges faced by the Muslim community, including but not limited to:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Algorithmic Bias, including how technology is used to identify ways in which algorithms and models are used to discriminate against Muslim individuals and communities in different contexts, and mitigation strategies.</li>
    <li>Language and Speech, including: bridging gaps in to decrease disparity in Arabic-speaking groups, expanding support for tools using Arabic character sets, accurate transcription and translation for religious texts.</li>
    <li>Data Collection and Representation, including challenges in collecting representative data for muslim communities, collecting data from diverse dialects and vernaculars.</li>
    <li>Leveraging AI for Community Engagement and Outreach, including engaging Muslim youth in AI and ML.</li>
  </ul> -->
