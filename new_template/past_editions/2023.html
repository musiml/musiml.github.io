          <h2 id="call-for-abstracts">Call for Abstracts</h2>
          <hr>
    
      <p>We invite submissions of extended abstracts for the Muslims in ML Workshop at NeurIPS 2024. We invite submissions both from authors who self-identify as Muslim (Track 1) and by authors researching topics that address challenges faced by the Muslim community (Track 2). Papers are published in a non-archival format and may have been published in other venues before or may be published in other venues in the future.</p>
      
      <p>Authors of accepted abstracts will be invited to a poster session. Selected abstracts will be additionally invited to give a lighting talk. Talks will follow a hybrid format, with authors having the option to present in person or remotely; however, all posters must be presented in person. Additionally, participants will have the exciting opportunity to present at a joint poster session with all affinity groups at NeurIPS (e.g. Women in ML, Black in AI.). We will recognize outstanding posters with a Best Poster Award.</p>

      <p>The Muslims in ML workshop focus on both the potential for advancement and harm to Muslims and those in Muslim-majority countries who religiously identify, culturally associate, or are classified by proximity, as “Muslim”. Track 1 is designed to broadly showcase research by Muslim scholars in ML. Track 2 is designed to highlight work addressing challenges faced by the muslim community. Both tracks aim to promote awareness, collaboration, and mitigation strategies to ensure fair and equitable implementation of AI/ML technologies for Muslims worldwide.</p>

        <li>Reinforcement learning (e.g., decision and control, planning, hierarchical RL, robotics)</li>
        <li>Social and economic aspects of machine learning (e.g., fairness, interpretability, human-AI interaction, privacy, safety, strategic behavior)</li>
        <li>Theory (e.g., control theory, learning theory, algorithmic game theory)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Track 2</h3>

          <p>Talk Title: <i>Unruly Data: On the Archives and Counter-Archives of Drone Warfare</i></p>
          
          <p> <b> Abstract: </b>
          This talk asks: what can a standpoint situated amidst the smoldering ruins of drone bombardment in a post-colonial village in a post-colonial country teach us about the racial technics of digital war? US drones began bombing the Pakistan-Afghan borderlands in 2004. Over two decades of the war on terror, the weaponized drone has become the emblem of US techno-imperial power. It inspires terror and awe. Scholarship on the drone war has yielded important insights into the sociotechnical assemblage that constitutes the drone—from image analysts to pilots, to drone cameras, algorithmic kill lists, and data mining. In so doing however, it has tended to orient around US technics and the figure of the US drone pilot. Such work, while sympathetic to the racialized victims of war and colonialism, has nevertheless sometimes treated these subaltern social worlds as un-generative sites for elaborating an analytics of digital war. This presentation draws on ethnographic fieldwork amidst populations from the Pakistan-Afghan borderlands to decenter the drone so that we can better understand the drone war. It asks about the possibilities for generating what I tentatively term unruly data, forms of knowledge that is not reducible to the categories of “militants” or “civilians” often used to debate, discuss, and adjudicate drone bombardment.

          <p> <b> Speaker Biography: </b>
          Madiha Tahir is an Assistant Professor of American Studies and the co-director of the Yale Ethnography Hub. She is an interdisciplinary scholar of technology and war with interest and expertise in digital war, surveillance, militarism, and empire and technology studies from below. Her work intersects the anthropology of war with insights from the fields of postcolonial, South Asian, and Black Studies literatures to reframe our understanding of technology, war, and US imperialism.

          <p>Talk Title: <i>Red Teaming Generative AI Systems</i><p>
          
          <p> <b> Abstract: </b>
          As generative AI systems continue to evolve, it is crucial to rigorously evaluate their robustness, safety, and potential for misuse. In this talk, we will explore the application of red teaming methodologies to assess the vulnerabilities and limitations of these cutting-edge technologies. By simulating adversarial attacks and examining system responses, we aim to uncover latent risks and propose effective countermeasures to ensure the responsible deployment of generative AI systems in new domains and modalities.

          <hp>Talk Title: <i>Adversarial Examples Beyond Security</i></p>
          
          <p> <b> Abstract: </b>
          Adversarial examples are often perceived as threats that deceive AI models, posing security risks. This talk aims to reframe adversarial examples as beneficial tools, emphasizing their positive impact on AI deployment. Specifically, we will discuss their application in two key areas: designing robust objects and safeguarding against unauthorized AI-based image manipulations. Our discussion will offer a nuanced perspective on the role of adversarial examples in AI.

          <p>Talk Title: <i>Editing Language Models with Natural Language Feedback</i></p>
          
          <p> <b> Abstract: </b>
          Even the most sophisticated language models are not immune to inaccuracies, bias or becoming obsolete, highlighting the need for efficient model editing. Model editing involves altering a model's knowledge or representations to achieve specific outcomes without the need for extensive retraining. Traditional research has focused on editing factual data within a narrow scope—limited to knowledge triplets like 'subject-object-relation.' Yet, as language model applications broaden, so does the necessity for diverse editing approaches. In this talk, I will describe our work that introduces a novel dataset where edit requests are natural language sequences, expanding the editing capabilities beyond factual adjustments to encompass a more comprehensive suite of modifications including bias mitigation. This development not only enhances the precision of language models but also increases their adaptability to evolving information and application demands.

          Feyza is a fifth year PhD student in natural language processing advised by Prof. Derry Wijaya. Her research focuses on editing and improving machine learning models after deployment. Examples to post-hoc editing include increasing number of classes that an object classifier recognizes, improving the outputs of language models through machine generated feedback and model editing with natural language instructions.
