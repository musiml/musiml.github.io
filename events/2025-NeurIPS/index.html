          Muslims In ML (MusIML) is an affinity workshop dedicated to amplifying the voices of Muslim researchers in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence and addressing challenges and research topics that are particularly relevant to Muslims.
        </br>
        We focus on both the potential for advancement and harm to Muslims and those in Muslim-majority countries who religiously identify, culturally associate, or are classified by proximity, as "Muslim".
      
      <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/loc/san-diego/affinity-workshop/126047" target="_blank">Our next workshop will be held at NeurIPS 2025. Check here for details.</a>
      </p>

      <h2>Our Goals</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>The Muslims in ML Workshop aims to:</p>

      <ul>
          <li>Build a global network of Muslim researchers and professionals in ML.</li>
          <li>Promote research that addresses biases and challenges faced by Muslim communities.</li>
          <li>Provide mentorship and networking opportunities for researchers, particularly from Muslim-majority countries.</li>
          <li>Create space for discussions on ethical AI, inclusivity, and decolonizing AI research.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Our Mission and Vision</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The MusIML workshop seeks to provide a platform for the machine learning community to engage in thoughtful discussions about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies on Muslim individuals and communities. Our goal is to highlight both the opportunities for advancement and the risks of harm to those who identify with, are culturally connected to, or are categorized as Muslim.
            We aim to foster an inclusive environment where issues related to bias, ethical concerns, and representation in AI and ML can be addressed through research, collaboration, and advocacy. By bringing together academics, professionals, and practitioners, we strive to ensure that the benefits of ML extend equitably to Muslim communities while minimizing potential harms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our vision is to create a more equitable and just future where AI and ML technologies work to uplift Muslim communities, reduce societal biases, and foster innovation that respects and values cultural, religious, and ethical differences. We envision a world where Muslims and those in Muslim-majority regions are empowered to contribute to and benefit from advancements in machine learning.
            Through ongoing discussions, research, and collaborations, we aspire to create positive change by addressing systemic challenges in technology, enhancing inclusion, and advocating for fair representation of Muslims in the ML field.

        <h2>Workshop Overview</h2><hr>
        <p>The MusIML workshop serves as a platform for researchers and practitioners to explore the intersection of machine learning, AI, and Muslim communities. Our mission is to promote high-quality research that not only fosters growth within Muslim communities but also advances strategies to improve fairness, inclusion, and ethical AI. We encourage contributions that address these challenges and highlight how ML can be a tool for positive change, especially for Muslims in both Muslim-majority countries and global communities.</p>

        <h2>Workshop Tracks</h2><hr>

        <h3>Track 1: ML research addressing challenges faced by Muslim communities and research related to Islamic contexts</h3>
        <p>This track is open to all researchers, regardless of religious or ethnic background, and encourages submissions that promote the use of ML to support and empower Muslim communities globally, including in Muslim-majority countries. Published and/or In-progress work is welcome. Areas of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Growth of Muslims in ML:</strong> Initiatives that expand educational and professional opportunities for Muslims in ML, promote access, and encourage representation in the field.</li>
          <li><strong>ML for Social Good:</strong> Using ML/AI to engage Muslim youth, promote community outreach, enhance societal well-being, and improve governance, healthcare, or education in Muslim communities.</li>
