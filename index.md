## Overview

Muslims In ML (MusIML) is an affinity workshop for the NeurIPS community. 

We focus on both the potential for advancement and harm to muslims and those in muslim-majority countries who religiously identify, culturally associate, or are classified by proximity, as “muslim”.

Workshop will run on Friday, Dec 12 . We will feature pre-recorded talks, with live Q/A sessions on Friday. This will be followed by a short panel discussion.
