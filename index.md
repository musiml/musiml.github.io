## Overview

Muslims In ML (MusIML) is an affinity workshop for the NeurIPS community. 

We focus on both the potential for advancement and harm to those who religiously identify, culturally associate, or are classified by proximity, as 'Muslim'.

Workshop will run on Friday for 3 hrs. We will feature 4 pre-recorded 15 min talks, with live Q/A sessions on Friday. This will be followed by a short panel discussion.
