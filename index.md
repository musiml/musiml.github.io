## Overview

Muslims In ML (MusIML) is an affinity workshop for the NeurIPS community. 

We focus on both the potential for advancement and harm to Muslims and those in Muslim-majority countries who religiously identify, culturally associate, or are classified by proximity, as “Muslim”.

We plan to host our next workship at NeurIPS in 2023. Stay tuned for details!

<!-- The workshop will run on Tuesday, December 8, 2020 from 10:30AM - 1:30PM EST.  -->

<!-- We will feature a combination of pre-recorded and live talks, followed by a panel discussion with authors on the intersection of policy, technology, and Muslim communities.  -->
