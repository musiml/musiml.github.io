## Overview

Muslims In ML (MusIML) is an affinity workshop for the machine learning community. 

We focus on both the potential for advancement and harm to Muslims and those in Muslim-majority countries who religiously identify, culturally associate, or are classified by proximity, as “Muslim”.

Our next workshop will be held in New Orleans at NeurIPS 2023. While the majority of the workshop will happen in-person, we will also offer virtual attendance options for those unable to attend.
