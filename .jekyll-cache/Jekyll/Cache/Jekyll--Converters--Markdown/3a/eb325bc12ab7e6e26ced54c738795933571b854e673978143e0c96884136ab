<p>Muslims In ML (MusIML) is an affinity workshop for the NeurIPS community.</p>

<p>We focus on both the potential for advancement and harm to Muslims and those in Muslim-majority countries who religiously identify, culturally associate, or are classified by proximity, as ‚ÄúMuslim‚Äù.</p>

<p>The workshop will run on Tuesday, December 8, 2020 from 10:30AM - 1:30PM EST.</p>

<p>We will feature a combination of pre-recorded and live talks, followed by a panel discussion with authors on the intersection of policy, technology, and Muslim communities.</p>

<p>Language and Speech: Many Muslim-majority groups communicate in language that use Arabic character sets, yet there is a gap in learning and machine learning tools that work well in these environments. The following invited talks consider potential solutions such as extending resources to include Arabic character sets to decrease disparity in Arabic-speaking groups.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Abubakar Abid: Investigating Anti-Muslim Bias in GPT-3 through Words, Images, &amp; Stories</li>
  <li>Nayel Shafei: Creating Multilingual Corpora for Arabic Characterset</li>
  <li>Mona Diab: Data Paucity and Low Resource Scenarios: Challenges and Opportunities</li>
  <li>Samhaa El-Beltagy: NLU Meets Islamic Religious Phrases: Highlighting the Challenges</li>
</ul>

<p>Algorithmic Bias: These invited talks explore how technology is used to identify ways in which algorithms and models are used to discriminate against Muslim individuals and communities in different contexts.</p>
