<p>Language and Speech: Many Muslim-majority groups communicate in language that use Arabic character sets, yet there is a gap in learning and machine learning tools that work well in these environments. The following invited talks consider potential solutions such as extending resources to include Arabic character sets to decrease disparity in Arabic-speaking groups.</p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract:</h3>

<p>In this short talk I use the conceptual framing of a digital enclosure to consider the way Uyghur and Kazakh societies in Northwest China have been enveloped by a surveillance system over the past decade. I show how novel enclosures are produced and, in turn, construct new frontiers in capital accumulation and state power. The Turkic Muslim digital enclosure system began with the construction of 3-G cellular wireless networks which provided Uyghurs and Kazakhs with interactive smart-phone enabled capabilities across time and space. But over time state authorities paid private technology companies to build a data-intensive system with a wide range of spatial scales and information analytics that came to center on ‚ÄúMuslim‚Äù social media assessment and ethno-racialized face recognition technology. This complex matrix of overlaid enclosures assessed and controlled the movements and behavior of Muslims in increasingly intimate ways, resulting in mass detentions in ‚Äúreeducation‚Äù camps. What makes the case in Northwest China unique beyond its scale and cruelty, is that in this context rather than banishing targeted populations solely to human warehousing spaces such as peripheral ghettos, camps or prisons, the digital enclosure works to explicitly ‚Äúreeducate‚Äù the population as industrial workers and implement a forced labor regime.</p>

<h3 id="speaker-biography-1">Speaker Biography:</h3>

<p>Darren Byler is a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Asian Studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He researches the dispossession of ethno-racial Muslim minorities through forms of surveillance and digital capitalism in China and the global South. His book, Terror Capitalism: Uyghur Dispossession and Masculinity in a Chinese City (Duke University Press 2021), examines emerging forms of media, infrastructure, economics and politics in the Uyghur homeland in Chinese Central Asia. His current research considers how biotechnical surveillance systems can be tied to new forms of control both in China and in sites across the world where these technologies are exported. Prior to joining the University of Colorado he was Lecturer in Anthropology at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>

<h3 id="abstract-1">Abstract:</h3>

<p>In an era unstructured data abundance, you would think that we have solved our data requirements for building robust systems for language processing. However, this is not the case if we think on a global scale with over 7000 languages where only a handful have digital resources. Moreover, systems at scale with good performance typically require annotated resources.The existence of a handful of resources in a some languages is a reflection of the digital disparity in various societies leading to inadvertent biases in systems. In this talk I will show some solutions for low resource scenarios, both cross domain and genres as well as cross lingually.</p>

<h3 id="speaker-biography-2">Speaker Biography:</h3>

<p>Professor Mona Diab conducts research in Statistical Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a rapidly growing, exciting field of research in artificial intelligence and computer science. Interdisciplinarity is inherent to NLP, drawing on the fields of computer algorithms, software engineering, statistics, machine learning, linguistics, pragmatics, information technology, etc. In NLP, researchers model language and its use, and build both analytical models and predictive ones. In Professor Diab‚Äôs NLP lab, they address problems in social media processing, building robust enabling technologies such as syntactic and semantic processing tools for written texts in different languages, information extraction tools for large data, multilingual processing, machine translation, and computational sociolinguistic processing. Professor Diab has a special interest in Arabic NLP, where the emphasis has been on investigating Arabic dialect processing where there are very few available automated resources.</p>

<h3 id="abstract-2">Abstract:</h3>

<p>In this short talk, Roya Pakzad will speak about her current project entitled ‚ÄúNuanced Counter-Narratives of Being Muslim Online.‚Äù The goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of how marginalized groups create counter-narratives, who amplifies them, how sustainable they are, and how their impact differs. By providing various examples, she will also touch on how technology companies‚Äô business models and their third-party relationships impact Muslims and people from Muslim-majority countries. The talk will conclude with recommendations for design and policy interventions.</p>

<h3 id="abstract-3">Abstract:</h3>

<p>Social media continues to grow in its scope, importance, and toxicity. Hate speech is ever-present in today‚Äôs social media, and causes or contributes to dangerous situations in the real world for those it targets. Anti-Muslim bias and hatred has escalated in both public life and social media in recent years. This talk will overview a new and ongoing project in identifying Islamophobia in social media using techniques from Natural Language Processing. I will describe our methods of data collection and annotation,and discuss some of the challenges we have encountered thus far. In addition I‚Äôll describe some of the pitfalls that exist for any effort attempting to identify hate speech (automatically or not).</p>
